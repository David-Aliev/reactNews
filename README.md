# ReactNews

#### ReactNews is a frontend app that allows you to view all current news in the present time.

## Technologies

### Frontend
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro)
- [JS]
- [HTML]
- [CSS]

In the near future, I will add typification using typescript, make it possible to go to another page when clicking on a news item with react-router-dom, and also add redux-toolkit.
