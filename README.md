# ReactNews

#### ReactNews is a frontend app that allows you to view all current news in the present time.

## Technologies

### Frontend
- [React]
- [Axios]
- [TypeScript]
- [JS]
- [HTML]
- [CSS]
- [ReduxToolkitQuery]
- [ReduxToolkit]

In the near future, I will add typification using typescript, make it possible to go to another page when clicking on a news item with react-router-dom, and also add redux-toolkit.
